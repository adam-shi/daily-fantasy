Tournament:

Top 20% or so win money, minimum return on win is 2x. Good strategy seems to be to bet many different lineups within the same pool in order to hedge risks on individual players. Different lineups can be generated by genetic algorithm (introduces randomness) or by calculated spreads on different players (more guaranteed reward if we can figure out a way to accomplish this, but harder).

Double-up:

Top 50% win 1.8x return. From speaking to people who play regularly, entering the same lineup multiple times per day seems to be the typical strategy. Either win all or lose all typically. Therefore we should try to pick a lineup that is both high predicted value and low variance to have a high probability of winning. Need to adjust how much we value each aspect to pick the best lineup each day.

Two-part problem:

Projection of game stats - if we knew perfectly what the stats will be for each game ahead of time, would be (relatively) easy to pick the optimal lineup. However since we cannot predict the future, we must use projections from other people or make our own. Creating our own will be quite challenging but if we have a predictor that is much more accurate than any publicly available predictor we will have a huge advantage in choosing lineups.

Lineup picking - based off the best predictor available, use results to pick a lineup that maximizes value. Brute force checking every combination is not feasible due to this problem being NP-hard (0-1 knapsack). Based off research, genetic algorithm seems to be a good option if we play around with the parameters and options. Other machine learning algorithms could work as well but I am not familiar yet with other viable/relevant ones.
